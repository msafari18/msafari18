# Hi there 👋 I'm Monireh Safari

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Waterloo and a research intern at the Vector Institute and Princess Margaret Cancer Research Center.  
My work lies at the intersection of **machine learning** and **genomics**, where I'm exploring how we can use deep learning models to better the phylogenetic tree and cell lineage tree (🤔 read more here: [phylogenetic tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree), [cell lineage tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_lineage)).

## A bit about me 🌱

🔬 Currently working on:

- Designing a pipeline for **single-cell lineage tree reconstruction** in **cancer cells** @[Gaiti lab](https://www.gaitilab.com/)
- Understanding **environmental patterns in extremophile genomes** using clustering and classification @[Kari genomics lab]([https://www.gaitilab.com/](https://github.com/Kari-Genomics-Lab))
- developing a family of **transformer-based models**, [BarcodeBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02401) and [BarcodeMAE](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=KIlvvosAAAAJ&citation_for_view=KIlvvosAAAAJ:2osOgNQ5qMEC), to study insect diversity through DNA barcodes @[BIOSCAN-ml](https://github.com/bioscan-ml)

🎓 Previously:
- Master's in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology
- Built **graph neural networks** for gene classification in **cancer research**

📍 Based in Waterloo, ON, Canada
